# testing_a_service

Task is to develop an extensive list of test cases that will thoroughly test every function in Controller.java, Response.java, and Student.java using JUnit and Mockito. You will be using Maven to run your test cases. Note that writing a large number of test cases and writing good test cases are different things. More does not always mean better. Try to come up with test cases that cover almost all the control flows that can happen in the code provided. Each test case should ideally check only one aspect of the code. For example, if you are trying to check a studentâ€™s GPA and their email ID, those should be two separate test cases rather than one.
