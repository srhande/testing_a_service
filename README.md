Repository for CSE 12 projects
1. PA1 Name: Testing a Service
2. Description: The test files, TestStudent.java, TestResponse.java, TestController.java, test the main files, Student.java, Response.java, Controller.java. These tests essentially are there to test that we are receiving and setting the information of a service correctly.
3. Features: We have tests that use Mockito to create mock objects that help us implement methods or classes that may be incorrect by inheriting their behavior as a mock, and then we use junit testing to create tests. We run using maven.

5. Acknowledgements: I used the tutorials we were given in the PA writeup, those being documentation links and junit, Mockito tutorials. I also used the ZyBook textbook to read up on exceptions.
